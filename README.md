# Respiratory Distress Recognition

This Project contains all necessary code and scripts to train a respiratory distress recognition model ([TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/overview)) usable with an Arduino Nano BLE Sense and a LEAP capacitive stretch sensor.

## Setup

### Arduino IDE

For installation instructions see <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software>.

#### Arduino Nano BLE Sense Support

Setup the Arduino IDE to support the Arduino Nano BLE Sense by installing it via the Boards manager. Version used was 3.0.1.

#### LEAP Stretch Sensor 

The stretch sensor was used with a small circuit allowing to measure discharge time. More information see https://leaptechnology.com/product/stretch-sensors and https://circuits4you.com/2016/05/13/capacitance-measurement-arduino/
